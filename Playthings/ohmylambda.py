# time to do some of them lambda/closure functions n such.
# Also, VisualStudio Code?
# On a side note, it seems like people go "You know what sounds like fun?!? Making a language.
# Mine will be more perfect than the rest because there are no drawbacks to any descision ever. Yeah."
# And then they go "That's too hard. Let's made an IDE. If that's too much then I'll strip out almost everything and market it like the new Vim."
# And so here we are.

# Back to lambdas. Which I feel like I finally understand.
# It's remarkable how complicated people can make things sound when the idea is unremarkable simple.
